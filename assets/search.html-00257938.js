It will create a new table, record the parent directory, name, and size of every object, but the search does not split words which means that match whether the keywords you enter appear in the name of object. In general, if you don&#39;t have a specific search requirement, we recommend you choose it.</li><li><code>database (non-full-text search)</code>: The full-text search mode is used above, but full-text search will have some strange problems when using <strong>MySQL database</strong> as an Alist database, which has not been resolved yet, so if your Alist database Change to <strong>MySQL</strong>, and your Alist version <strong><code>≥3.9.1</code></strong> It is recommended that you use this to build an index, although it is slower than full-text search and the gap is not very big, but it will not search for strange files , it’s more secure. After the future version is repaired, we will inform you to use the new full-text search to build the index. If you are using <strong>sqlite3</strong>, you can use whichever you like.</li><li><code>bleve</code>: An open source full-text search engine. It will split the words in the name of object and search for the keywords you enter.
