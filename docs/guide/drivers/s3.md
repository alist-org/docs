## **Add object storage examples and official documents**

`S3 Object Storage` includes but is not limited to these. There are many more, such as Microsoft and Google, which have not been added. There are no examples here because it is difficult to register and activate and cannot provide example tutorials. If you have an account, please contact us and provide an account and I will add it.

[**Comparison Table of Endpoints in Different Regions of OSS under Public Cloud**](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/31837.html)

::: tip
Alist needs to skip `referer` to mount **Alibaba Cloud Disk**. If you do not allow `referer` to be empty in anti-leech, it will not work, because Alibaba Cloud Disk uses Alibaba Cloud OSS (in Beijing area)

In fact, the `Region|Region` option can be written as `Endpoint`, but for the sake of specification, let’s write it according to the comparison table.:::

Advantages: [free 10G](https://www.jdcloud.com/cn/activity/oss), support IPV6
Disadvantages: need to precharge 100 to open，However, after the pre-deposit is completed, the object storage is activated, and the pre-deposited amount can still be used after withdrawal.

@tab Amazon

[**Amazon S3 Official Website**](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)

The endpoint URL contains the name of the region where the bucket is located

Example ^1^, if your bucket is in the US East (Ohio) region

> Then the format of the Endpoint URL is **`s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name`**
>
> Region parameter: **`us-east-2`**
>
> Bucket name: **`your-bucket-name`** (your own bucket name)

Example^2^, my storage bucket is `Tokyo`, and the name of the storage bucket is `cdn-aw`, then the complete parameter filling is as follows

>1. **Endpoint**: s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
>2. **Region**: ap-northeast-1
>3. **Bucket Name**: cdn-aw

Let's take a look at the complete parameter filling example

Fill in example:

@tab R2

[**cloudflare R2 Official Website**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)

**Endpoint** ：The S3 endpoint is available via the  **`https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`**  endpoint.

**`ACCOUNT_ID`** ：This account ID can be seen everywhere, and the simplest is the position at the top of the browser. The string of IDs behind the website link is your account ID.

@tab Minio

Those who use `Minio` self-built object storage should know how to obtain the ID and secret key, so I won’t talk about it here

You only need to fill in the four options of bucket name, access key ID, security access key, and Endpoint, and leave the region empty

**Endpoint：http(s):\//《YOUR_IP/URL》:9001/**，You can use IP or domain name

Finally, remember to enable **`Force Path Style`** to use, otherwise it cannot be used [Click to view details](https://github.com/alist-org/alist/discussions/4920#discussioncomment-6635452)

填写示例：

@tab Google Cloud

I assume you already have a Google Cloud account, so let’s go directly to the Google Cloud Storage settings page.[Click me](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings;tab=interoperability)

Then you will enter the following page:

![Google Cloud](/img/drivers/s3/googleStorage1.png)

You can see Endpoint and Access Key on this page, you need to select an account and create an Access Key

![Google Cloud](/img/drivers/s3/googleStorage2.png)

Access Key/Secret will be displayed on the new page, They will only be displayed this time. Please save them properly.

![Google Cloud](/img/drivers/s3/googleStorage3.png)

At this point, the EndPoint, access key Id, and security access key required by Alist have been obtained. Please view the remaining buckets and regions in the corresponding buckets.
