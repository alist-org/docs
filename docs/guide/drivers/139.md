<br/>



## **Type**

1. Personal Cloud: Choose Personal Cloud

2. Family Cloud: Choose Family Cloud

3. Personal new：New API
   - Only newly registered accounts are available. You can distinguish them by searching for `getDisk` in the request. If it can be found, it is the old version. If it cannot be found, it is the new version.


If you have a new version of the API, you will not be able to use the `Personal Cloud` type. Although there is no error message, the file will not be loaded.

If there is a `getDisk` request, the `New Personal` type cannot be used, otherwise it will prompt `User does not exist`

<br/>



## **Other**

1. Other information is taken from the request, which has changed from cookie to obtaining `Authorization`
   1. The new personal cloud can be obtained in another way. See the picture example of [Personal new](#personal-new)

2. If you can't find the load on the bottom of the request information, go to the top `on the top of the upper row, marked the purple highlight
