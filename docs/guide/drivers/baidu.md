# Baidu Netdisk

:::tip
Due to the limitation of Baidu Disk API, downloading files larger than about 20M needs to carry the header: "User-Agent": "pan.baidu.com", so when downloading files larger than 20M, you need to set the request header yourself, such as using curl:
```bash
curl -L -X GET 'YOUR_LINK' -H 'User-Agent: pan.baidu.com'
```
Or use the proxy function in this program to transfer.

### **Refresh token**
[Click here](https://openapi.baidu.com/oauth/2.0/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=iYCeC9g08h5vuP9UqvPHKKSVrKFXGa1v&redirect_uri=https://alist.nn.ci/tool/baidu/callback&scope=basic,netdisk&qrcode=1) to get the refresh token.



### **Root folder path**
The root foler to mount, defaults to `/`

- Mount a folder separately, according to the following format, `/` is the root directory, just extend to that directory if you want to mount that directory
  - /folder_A/....../folder_x

### **Custom crack ua**

[**UA used when using 【Native Proxy & Crack API】**](https://github.com/alist-org/alist/issues/5602#issuecomment-1831188682)

<br/>



### **Download api**
- official: The official interface, very stable, but for larger files, UA needs to be modified and the speed is slow (SVIP speed fast)
- crack: unofficial interface，You must modify the UA and some files may not have a speed limit, but it will be unstable (not guaranteed 100%availability) Need to use a version greater than `3.19.0`
  -  ==Need to change the UA to`netdisk`==，Modification method refer to [add-user-agent-user-example](#add-user-agent-usage-example)
  -  Or turn on the Web proxy, you do not need to modify the UA (you need a large broadband to use it stably)
  -  It is limited to play/download **`video (only tested in the mp4 format other formats are not tested)`**,If it is other format files, such a prompt will appear
  -  This is not a mistake, this is a limit, please do not panic.

```json{3}
{
	error_code: 31119,
	error_msg: "hit black userlist , hit illeage dlna",
	request_id: 541111111111111140
}
# This is not a mistake, this is a limit, please do not panic.
```

<br/>



### **Add "User-Agent" usage example**

::::danger If you don't know how to set "User-Agent" see here

 ==The following methods are limited to Baidu super member users== 

 ==Prompt again The following methods are limited to Baidu super member users== 

It will only be useful if a member finishes modifying **`"User-Agent"`** (choose official and 302)

If you don’t change **`"User-Agent"`**, you can enable ==Web Agent==, the disadvantage is that you need to build an Alist machine for transfer, that is to say, you need a large broadband to help you transfer

@tab Web plugin

- The advantage of using a browser plug-in to modify is that it can be played directly online, of course, downloading is also possible.
