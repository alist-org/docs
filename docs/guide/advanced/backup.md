# Backup&Restore

## **Method 1-Built-in**

Use `AList` to manage `Backup/Restore` options

> 1. Backup: Backup Alist data (==**does not include index**==) 
>
> 2. Recovery: Backup files before recovery 
>
> 3. Override: Select override when recovery, and will override the user information
> 4. Encryption Password:Fill in the `ENCRYPTION PASSWORD` Export, the information will be encrypted when exporting.You also need to enter the `ENCRYPTION PASSWORD` first before importing.^^3.40.0_New^

## **Method 2-Sqlite3**

Back up the data/`data.db` database in the` AList` directory, and wait for the new environment to replace it directly (==**contains index data**==)

- If there are two files, if there are `data.db-shm` and `data.db-wal`, they must be backup together.
- It is recommended to stop running Alist and then backup, so that the two files of `data.db-shm` and`data.db-wal` will be merged with the `data.db`

## **Method 3-Other database**

Other, if you use `mysql, postgres` and other non ` sqlite database `, please solve it by yourself (==**include indexing data**==)
